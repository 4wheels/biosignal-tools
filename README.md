# BioSignal Tools

The BioSig project is an open source software library for biomedical signal processing, such as analysis of EEG, ECoG, ECG, EOG, EMG, respiration, and so on. To learn easier, it was arbitrarily forked from [the original project](http://biosig.sourceforge.net/index.html).

## Disclaimer

This repository was not created by original contributors, but forked here under a open source lisence on Feb 6th, 2015. To see the latest updates by the author, you must go to [the original project](http://biosig.sourceforge.net/index.html)(on SourceForge).

However, **any contribution or discussion was welcomed**! I believe everyone's effort is essencial in an open source culture. Feel free to leave your Pull Request or Issues.

## Features

BioSig consists of some (more or less) coherent parts, for more details take a look at [the project page](http://biosig.sourceforge.net/projects.html):

- BioSig for Octave and Matlab (biosig4octmat): A toolbox for Octave and Matlab with powerful data import and export filters, feature extraction algorithms, classification methods, and a powerful viewing and scoring software.
- BioSig for C/C++ (biosig4c++): A C/C++ library that provides reading and writing routines for different biosignal data formats.
- rtsBCI (rtsbci): A real-time BCI system implemented in Matlab and Simulink.
- BioProFeed (bioprofeed)
- BCIx (bcix)
