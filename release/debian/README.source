biosig4c++ for Debian
---------------------

Source package is generated from git repository directly, thus do not
expect tarballs to match using md5sum against the ones released
upstream.

TinyXML
~~~~~~~

Upstream carries modified copy of tinyxml with enabled support of
compression, which was not accepted upstream in tinyxml (yet, if
ever).
